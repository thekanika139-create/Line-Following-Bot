# What I learned  
pid, pcbs, microcontrollers, motors, sensors, how to code arduino, How to make line following robot using IR sensor  
# What Can be done better  
See more videos and write the whole code on my own and get to know about the real analysis by doing the physical experiment  
# WHat Problem I faced  
from where I should Start, time issue, what is the website to check whether my code is right or not using simulation
